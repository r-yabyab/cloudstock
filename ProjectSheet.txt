Real time stock updates to supplement stock trading. 
Resizeable and moveable stock components so you can put it next to your trading
platform.

Aims:
To pull real time stock updates. When it's globex hours, users can still view
the session's updates.
Need to include futures updates when I get paid futures subscriptions.


Structure:
App.js displays the initial HomePage route, options for other routes
HomePage.js is the main parent of all components
DataFetch.js used to select and update symbols on the list
    Provides states for Stat.js that makes Promise to fetch all symbols at once
